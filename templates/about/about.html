    <p class="about-text">
      ERAI Cleaning was born from experience — built by professionals who’ve worked in the industry and understand what it means to care for a space like it's your own.
      <br><br>
      We believe that cleaning is not just a service, but a trust. That’s why every project we take on — whether it's a cozy café, a high-traffic office, or a new home — is handled with the same level of precision, discretion, and pride.

      <h2 class="section-title">Why ERAI?</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        We’ve worked from the ground up — from cleaners ourselves to founders who know every detail. That’s why our clients stay with us — because they see the difference in how we clean, how we talk, and how we care.
        <br><br>
        Whether you're a business owner looking for reliable cleaning, or someone who simply wants to come home to fresh air and gleaming floors — we're here for you.

      <h2 class="section-title">A Note from the Founder</h2>
      <p class="about-text">
        "I started ERAI Cleaning because I wanted to bring care back into cleaning. After working in the industry myself, I saw what was missing — empathy, pride, and consistency. Today, we’re not just offering cleaning services, we’re building long-term relationships with clients who value quality and peace of mind."  
        <br><br>
        — Aiman Yusupzhanov, Founder of ERAI Cleaning
